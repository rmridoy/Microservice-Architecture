# Microservice-Architecture
What is Microservice Architecture? It’s an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of a service which are highly maintainable, testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable, and organized around business capabilities. Lot’s of the businesses and companies nowadays are adopting microservice framework to their software’s because in microservice each-parts are independently built which then makes the testing, packaging, and deploying independent as well. This are the reasons why big companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Twitter are adopting Microservice architecture to the software’s, but however that doesn’t mean it’s appropriate for every company. In the bog it explained, the difference between Microservices, Miniservices, and Macroservices. Next, there are lot of cons in microservice as well as it has lot of pros, so one of the biggest challenges in the microservices architecture is that it has software complexity. In application of microservices, it has many more moving parts than the equivalent monolithic application, therefore you might end up with so many different languages and frameworks that the application becomes difficult to maintain. Also, existing tools are likely not compatible with new service dependencies. Last but not least, even though microservices gives better scalability but it gives poorer performance as it needs to communicate.
